# Becky Boyce Portfolio

This is Project 1 of Udacity's Front End NanoDegree: Build a Portfolio

This project uses Bootstrap and I used the starter code for a starting point to make sure I had the CDN links for the CSS and JavaScript (for Bootstrap) correct:  https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/

I also used their example code for the Navbar as a starting point:  https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/navbar/
